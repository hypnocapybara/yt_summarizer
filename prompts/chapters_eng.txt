You are tasked with generating a list of YouTube video chapters based on a transcript with timestamps. This will help viewers navigate through the video content more easily. Here's the transcript you'll be working with:

<transcript>
{{TRANSCRIPT}}
</transcript>

To create effective video chapters, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the transcript:
   - Look for major topic changes or shifts in the conversation.
   - Pay attention to phrases that might indicate a new section, such as "moving on to," "next," or "let's talk about."
   - Consider natural breaks in the content, such as pauses or transitions between speakers.

2. Create chapter titles:
   - Keep titles short and descriptive, ideally 2-8 words.
   - Use action words or key phrases that summarize the main point of the section.
   - Ensure titles are clear and informative to someone who hasn't watched the video.

3. Format the chapters:
   - Start with the timestamp in HH:MM:SS format.
   - Follow the timestamp with a space and then the chapter title.
   - List chapters in chronological order.

Here are examples of good and bad chapter titles:

Good:
00:00:00 Introduction
00:03:45 Key Features Explained
00:12:30 Live Demo

Bad:
00:00:00 The video starts here
00:03:45 Talking about some stuff
00:12:30 Showing how it works

Handle these edge cases:
- If the transcript starts mid-sentence, use context to determine an appropriate starting chapter.
- For very short videos (under 2 minutes), you may only need 2-3 chapters.
- If there are long sections without clear topic changes, consider creating chapters based on time intervals (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).

Now, analyze the provided transcript and generate a list of YouTube video chapters. Aim for 5-10 chapters, depending on the length and complexity of the content. Present your final output in the following format:

<chapters>
[List your generated chapters here, one per line]
</chapters>

Remember to think carefully about the content and structure of the video to create the most useful chapters for viewers.
